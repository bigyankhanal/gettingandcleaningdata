Data for the project was found at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The purpose of this project is to merge the datasets, tidy the dataset, calculate mean and standard deviation and create the final dataset

For the implementation the following procedure was followed:

1. The following variables are for reading the various data in the tables

   a) x_train  b) y_train   c)subject_train 
   d) x_test   e) y_test    f)subject_test 
   g)features  h) activityLabels

2. Some variables as following 
   a) training_x  b) training_y  c) training_subject 
   d) testing_x   e) testing_y   f) testing_subject 
   g) activityLabels 
	were named for the specific column names.

3. The training, testing and Full data was merged under the variables:
   a) training_data_merged
   b) testing_data_merged
   c) Full_data
     All the column names of the Full data were saved under
						a) Full_data_names

4. The following variables was used to extract mean and std data 
making necessary subset and merge columns:
   a) mean_and_std
   b) MeanAndStd
   c) ActivityNames
 
5. Variables used to create other dataest with average and standard deviation are:
   a) second_TidySet 
  And the output text file is "second_TidySet.txt"
